### TSF-Internship-Task
Task 1 - To Explore Supervised Machine Learning In this regression task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

Taak 3 - To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm.For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and

visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this

classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

Task 4 - To explore Business Analytics.Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset

‘SampleSuperstore’

You are the business owner of the retail firm and want to see

how your company is performing. You are interested in finding

out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

What all business problems you can derive by looking into the

data? You can choose any of the tool of your choice

(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel).
